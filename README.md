# LeetCode Java Solutions

This repository contains my Java solutions to LeetCode problems.
I focus on:

- clean and readable code  
- understanding core algorithmic patterns  
- improving problem-solving skills  
- writing all solutions in IntelliJ  
- structuring solutions based on algorithm type

## Folder Structure
Each folder contains solutions for a specific pattern:

- arrays  
- strings  
- hashmap  
- two-pointers  
- sliding-window  
- linked-list  
- binary-search  
- trees (DFS/BFS)  
- dynamic-programming  

## Goal
Build strong fundamentals in algorithms and data structures while improving Java programming discipline.
